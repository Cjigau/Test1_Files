This file has a model of the IEEE 13 node test feeder with 2 house(s) attached
to node 611
Water heater is attached to house
and triplex object for dryer included

A meter monitors node 611 that measures the total power consumption of all
house/loads. This can be viewed in the "Meter_611_Power.csv", in column labeled
"meter611C:measured_power.real"

WH demand schedules - For each demand schedule, they have been adjusted to turn on
during dryer cycles and they don't turn on exactly at the same time to one another (there is some overlap).

Switch - auction and passive_controller objects have been implemented for 2 houses.
