This .glm is a sucessful set up with 2 houses  
with WH and Dryer for each house being read by 2 different meters, 
using the mutli_recorder object

I still need to work on uniform csv files...



update:2/25/2021
.glm file has been changed and updated.
a third meter was added at the node to measure the total consumption of the houses/loads

the csv. files included are not accurate, but demonstrate the simulation run sucessful.


update:2/27/2021
.glm file has been changed and updated.
uniform csv files have been created.
output of simulation is as expected.

please see lucid diagram for visual aid in what this script is.

-thank you!
